Graph:Graph is a collection of nodes(vertices) connected by edges.

G=(V,E) where

V- vertices(Nodes)
E- Edges(Connection between Nodes) 

Based on the structure graphs have six types:
i)Directed Graph
ii)Undirected Graph
iii)Weighted Graph
iv)Unweighted graph
v)Cyclic Graph
vi)Acyclic Graph

Implementation of Graph:
i)Adjacency Matrix
ii)Adjacency List
iii)Incidence Matrix


Graph Traversing(DFS and BFS)
Spanning Tree
Minimum Spanning Tree

Dijkstra Algorithm:

i)Initialize the distance to the source node as 0 and all other nodes as infinity.
ii)Use a priority queue to always expand the node with the shortest known distance.
iii)For the each adjacent nodes of the currently selected node 
  a)If a shorter path is found, update the distance.
  b)Push the updated node into the priority queue.
iv)Keep repeating until all nodes are visited or shortest distance to all nodes is found.
